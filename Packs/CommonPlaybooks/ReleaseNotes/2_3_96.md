#### Playbooks

##### Entity Enrichment - Generic v3

- Fixed an issue where risky users and hosts were not outputted from the Entity Enrichment playbook.
##### Endpoint Enrichment - Generic v2.1

- Fixed an issue that caused all risky hosts to be outputted, instead of only the risk context of the endpoint being enriched.
