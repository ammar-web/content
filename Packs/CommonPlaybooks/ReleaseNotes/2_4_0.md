##### Block URL - Generic

- The sub-playbook 'Add Indicator to Miner - Palo Alto MineMeld' has been removed as the MineMeld pack is no longer in use.
- The sub-playbook 'PAN-OS - Block IP and URL - External Dynamic List' is no longer in use and has been replaced by the Generic Export Service approach. Please add ad EDL server IP and EDL Tag to the playbook inputs to block URLs using EDL.
